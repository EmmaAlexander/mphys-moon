## Using Machine Learning to predict the first visibility of the New Crescent Moon in the UK

The visual sighting of the new crescent Moon is a key aspect of many religious and cultural calendars. Although the phase of the Moon can be precisely calculated, its actual observability as a thin crescent can depend on a number of factors. Previous academic studies have been based on data recorded at latitudes much lower than that of the UK, in locations where the weather is more astronomically favourable.

The aim of this project would be to combine UK observation reports of the crescent Moon, with other factors such as archival weather data, and build a machine learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of a lunar crescent being visible in the UK for any given month. The students will gain familiarity with astronomical Python libraries and their use with luni-solar ephemeris data, in addition to the development and application of machine learning algorithms to varied real-world datasets.

This project will be particularly well suited for students with interests in machine learning, the practicalities of amateur astronomy, and the cultural impact of astronomy. Some prior knowledge and experience of programming in Python would be beneficial.

### Work Plan

1. Literature review covering astrophysics (e.g. luni-solar geometries; criteria for new cresecent visibility e.g. Yallop/Odeh; observational practicalities) and machine learning (e.g. overview of use of ML in astrophysics, determination of most appropriate algorithm(s) for this project). 
2. Application of mathematics in Yallop 1997 (https://www.astronomycenter.net/pdf/yallop_1997.pdf) to reproduce q value calculations and visibility maps. 
3. Processing of archival Moon visibility data to form a ML-readable dataset, including augmenting the data (calculate useful parameters, add other relevent data etc).
4. Testing of different ML algorithms to evaluate their usefulness in this application, and apply the best to make future predictions. Evaluate what information is most important to make such predictions. 
6. Interpret and discuss results.

Optional extras: 

a. Additional section in literature review on cultural impact of the Moon/ astronomy in general (no more than 20\% of total lit review content).
b. Evaluation of ways to present first visibility maps to allow for greatest accessibility, especially for months which have a large public interest (e.g. the Islamic month of Ramadan). Creation of resources to aid in public understanding of the lunar cycle and how to observe it. (No more than 10\% of total project time)
