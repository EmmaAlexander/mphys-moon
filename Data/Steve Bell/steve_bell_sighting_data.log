Calculate JD, ARCL, ARCV, Age, Lag, Best Time, Parallax, Topocentric Width, q, Schaeffer Visibility Criterion , BDY criterion.
also calculate local sunset and moonset times to get lag time and best time. uncertainty is an estimate of how much earlier
the moon might have been visible - it is a kind of error bar. Sighting Y means the moon was seen, N means an attempt was made
without success. Do a Google search on "Schaeffer visibility criterion crescent moon" for references.

                                  75.9 hours old. Sun alt. 1.8 degrees / az. 301.1 degrees. Moon would have been visible earlier but as the
                                  crescent was seen through high cloud it is difficult to tell how much earlier. Crescent seen 116 minutes
                                  before the best time. Venus 8 degrees away from the crescent.

May 23rd    - Tue - A - 23:00 -   Cloud thinning to the point where a trivial sighting was made at 20:45 BST from Ash Priors, 23 minutes

June 19th   - Mon - A - 22:18 -   Went out at 22:00 BST to sight the new crescent moon. Some clear patches close to the north-western horizon
                                  but by no means clear. Had three attempts to spot the crescent between 22:00 BST (alt. 8.7 degrees) and 22:20
                                  BST (alt. 6.1 degrees)  all negative. Gave up at 22:20 BST as the crescent moon was likely to have dropped
                                  below the treeline. Moon illuminated fraction was approximately 2.8%.

June 20th   - Tue - A - 22:33 -   A sighting was made at 21:20 BST from Ash Priors, 10 minutes before sunset at 21:30 BST. Moon alt. 19.6

                                  63.7 hours old. Sun alt. 0.6 degrees / az. 308.5 degrees. The crescent may have been visible a little
                                  earlier had it been clear. It is difficult to tell how much earlier though. Crescent seen 73 minutes
                                  before the best time. Venus visible with the naked eye 15 degrees away from the crescent. Mars visible
                                  likewise at 22:25 BST.

June 21st   - Wed - A - 22:45 -   A sighting was made with binoculars at 20:12 BST from Ash Priors, 79 minutes before sunset at 21:31 BST.

                                  degrees. Age 86.6 hours old. Sun alt. 9.5 degrees / az. 295.7 degrees. Crescent seen with binoculars 153
                                  minutes before the best time. Venus not visible yet.mA sighting was made with the naked eye at 20:23 BST,
                                  68 minutes before sunset. Moon alt. 33.4 degrees / az. 263.9 degrees. Illumination 11.9% and elongation
                                  40 degrees east. Tilt ~20 degrees. Age 86.8 hours old. Sun alt. 8.0 degrees / az. 297.8 degrees. Crescent
                                  seen with the naked eye 142 minutes before the best time. Venus visible to the naked eye at 21:15 BST 4.5
                                  degrees away from the crescent moon.

June 22nd   - Thu - A - 22:53 -   Moon sighting at 16.05 BST from UKHO. Moon alt. 56.7 degrees / az. 161.15 degrees. Illumination 17.8% and

                                  minutes before the best time.

August 19th - Sat - A - 20:58 - Several attempts made to spot the ~10% illuminated crescent moon between 20:10 BST and 20:30 BST but nothing seen.
                                Some thin, high cloud around the western horizon up to about 15-20 degees. Cloud cleared in the appropriate
				direction to allow a trivial sighting at 20:35 BST. A sighting was made with the naked eye at 20:35 BST from Ash
				Priors, 9 minutes after sunset at 20:26 BST. Moon alt. 9.2 degrees / az. 257.8 degrees. Illumination 10.1% and
				elongation 37 degrees east. Tilt ~15 degrees. Age 81.9 hours old. Sun alt. -2.1 degrees / az. 293.2 degrees. The
				crescent was seen 22 minutes before the best time. 

                                Tilt of the line joining the cusps of the Moon measured westwards (i.e. clockwise) = 360 - (PAMBL+90 - PARANG).
                                PAMBL+90 degrees is the position angle of the northern cusp. PARANG is the parallactic angle of the Moon. Position
                                Angle of the Moon's Bright Limb is PAMBL - PARANG. For the August 19th sighting PAMBL = 291.93 degrees (MICA) and
                                PARANG = 37.9 degrees (Stellarium), then P.A. of the Moon's Bright Limb is 254.03 degrees, P.A. of the Moon's
                                northern cusp is 344.03 degrees and TILT is 15.97 degrees.
